 <!-- We are using edit class because there will be multiple
  rows of table data and all of them would be having the same
   id which is not correc approach -->

   dynamic elements are those which are not defined in html file and are declared
   inside of js file itself, these elements should lie outside of document.ready(function(){})

   in dynamic function selector we need any element that is static, then using 
   on() function we trigger the event.

   to edit or delete-
   1.you need the product id.
   2.with that id we'll fetch teh object from products array and fill in the from
   3.change values and update array with that object
   4.then we'll call display function again

    in jquery we don't pass values like products[i].id aur usko quotes me krke add
    kar dia , but we use custom variables and use data-nameofvariableinwhichispassed
